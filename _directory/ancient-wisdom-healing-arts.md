Ancient Wisdom Healing Arts is an integrated holistic team treating clients in all aspects of their lives, providing multiple practitioners within one company addressing as many needs of our clients as possible to improve their lives and health. Our practitioners strive to be models of health and healing who are committed to the process of self-exploration and development. We address all factors that influence a person's health, wellness and disease, including the mind, emotions, and spiritual care for each of our clients and their families. Our treatments are always customized according to their unique presentation and predisposing factors, and aim to address the underlying cause of their condition as well as its outward symptoms. We are advancing excellence in holistic health services and education. Our commitment of strengthening our relationships with our practitioners, volunteers, community partners, clients and friends to our mission permits us to maintain a quality of presence and tradition of caring. We are very thankful that we are able to practice our vocations in the Greeley, Colorado area and look forward to serving our community for many years to come.
