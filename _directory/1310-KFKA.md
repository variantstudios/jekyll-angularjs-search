KFKA is Coloradoâ€™s first commercially licensed radio station and is recognized as the second oldest radio station west of the Mississippi and fifth oldest radio station in the nation. KFKA signed on the air in May of 1921. KFKA programming by definition attracts listeners who are sophisticated, aware, and affluent. Each program is designed to entertain by being informational with specific focus. This allows an advertising message to be precisely targeted demographically.
